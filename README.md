# DEEPFAKE-DETECTION
The speedy development in Deepfake technology and manipulation has now come  to a degree in which it increases sizeable worries for the consequences in the  direction of society. At best, this results in a lack of consideration in virtual  content, however, may want to doubtlessly motivate in addition damage with the  aid of using spreading fake information or false news we examine the realism of  modern-day photo manipulations, and the way tough its miles to detect them, both  mechanically and with the aid of using humans. To standardize the assessment of  detection methods, we suggest an automatic benchmark for facial manipulation  detection. In particular, the benchmark is primarily based totally on Deepfakes  as distinguished representatives for facial manipulations at random compression  ranges and sizes. The benchmark is publicly available and consists of a hidden  check set as well as a database of over eight million manipulated media. This  dataset is over an order of significance large than comparable, publicly  available, forgery datasets. We will display that extra domain-particular  expertise improves deepfake detection. And we will detect that the particular  video is deepfake or not, within the presence of sturdy compression, and virtually  outperforms human observers.

A paper presented at the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2021 describes a new technique which renders deepfakes more fool proof, making it difficult for traditional tools to detect them.
“Current state-of-the-art methods for deepfake detection can be easily bypassed if the adversary has completed or even partial knowledge of the detector,” states the paper titled ‘Adversarial Deepfakes: Evaluating Vulnerability of Deepfake Detectors to Adversarial Examples’’.
Provenance, together with authentication, can provide important forensic tools to help debunk deepfakes.
Deepfake detection includes solutions that leverage multi-modal detection techniques to determine whether target media has been manipulated or synthetically generated.
**What are the threats posed by deepfake videos?**
With a proliferation of deepfake videos, there is a growing concern that they will be weaponized to run political campaigns and can be exploited by authoritarian regimes.
In 2019, a research organization called Future Advocacy and UK Artist Bill Posters created a video of UK PM Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn endorsing each other for the prime minister’s post. The group said the video was created to show the potential of deepfakes to undermine democracy.

Last year, before the Delhi Assembly polls, videos of Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari speaking in English and Haryanvi went viral. In these videos, Tiwari was seen criticising Arvind Kejriwal and asking people to vote for BJP. The videos, which were shared in over 5,000 WhatsApp groups, were later revealed to be deepfake, digital media firm Vice reported.

Deepfakes are also a cause for concern at a time when WHO has stated that the Covid-19 crisis has triggered an infodemic and there have been “deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals”.
Moreover, doctored videos — which include manipulating the content by using incorrect date stamps or location, clipping content to change the context, omission, splicing, and fabrication — are increasingly used nowadays on social media to deliberately misrepresent facts for political ends. Most of these videos show, how easy it can be to obfuscate facts and spread lies based on manipulated content masquerading as hard evidence.
**Methods for Deepfake Detection?**
To obtain a model which can detect deepfake videos in social media and show the promise to be extended eventually to a model for using at the edge. The Xception network paired with our classifier among ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception modules. The fnal framework consists of a Xception network and a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer with a dropout layer followed by a fully connected layer with 1024 nodes with dropout and followed by a softmax layer for classification. The CNN module extracts the spatial features and those feature vectors are fed into the classifier part. Finally, a classification result comes out from the classifier. To create a model which does not overfit easily, average pooling and dropout layers are added to the network accordingly.

**DEEPFAKE Classification.**
**Conclusion**
Deepfake detection is particularly important nowadays because the tools for making deepfakes are becoming more accessible, and social media sites will easily allowing people to distribute and share such fake content. Deep learning methods have received a lot of interest in a variety of areas. 
Although deep learning has shown a remarkable performance in deepfakes detection, the quality of deepfake has been increasing. Hence, the current deep learning methods need to improve as well to successfully identify fake videos and images. In addition, for the current deep learning methods, there is not a clear method to know the number of layers needed and which architecture is appropriate for deepfake detection. Another area of investigation is the incorporation of identification of deepfake detection methods into social media platforms in order to improve their effectiveness in coping with the pervasive effects of deepfakes and reduce their impacts.
Great skills have been achieved during the development of this project, time management is one of them, research in various areas of AI, machine learning, and deep learning at the end of the day it can be said that the task has been a great success incorporated with extraordinary challenges. All in all, the sleepless nights, stressful days and hard work have paid off and besides some good moments were also experienced. These experiences will be used for ever. On my Graduation course I learned many theoretical comprehensions. Using that knowledge and observing live operational system. My project is a fundamental approach of these. I have developed the project “DEEPFAKE DETECTION”.
